Increasing discussions on the topic of addiction to the Internet can now be found everywhere. The visual representation shown clearly and irrefutably suggests that a group of young people are concentrating on playing computers in their rooms without communication. It is clear that the picture is indicating that we must make efforts to get rid of the downsides of the virtual world.
For all to understand the social circumstance, discussions in two following aspects can be helpful. In the first place, many of us lack the conception of behaving well, which in turn leads to the habitual phenomenon of addiction to virtual world. Also, people who live in a complicated environment tend to take the passive role of being influenced by poor behaviors and imitate them. An authentic survey by the administration shows more than 95.3% people have opinions similar to mine. It turns out we will suffer a heavy loss, should we still make no improvement.
What response we should take is the question. Personally speaking, this phenomenon should be seriously rethought and the lessons must be learnt by all of us. On the social angle, parents and teachers can refer to bad examples to show the youth what the serious consequences are.
